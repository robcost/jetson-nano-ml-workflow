# Train Amazon SageMaker built-in Object Detection model using the augmented manifest file format

After the Ground Truth data labeling job is complete, notebooks in this section will walk through:

1. Prepare the output from our Ground Truth labeling job for model training - [Notebook 01](./01_Process%20SageMaker%20Ground%20Truth%20labeling%20job%20outputs%20for%20training.ipynb)
2. Submit a custom object detection training job - [Notebook 02](./02_sagemaker_training_API.ipynb)
3. Convert the output model artifact for making inference locally - [Notebook 03](./03_local_inference_post_training.ipynb)
